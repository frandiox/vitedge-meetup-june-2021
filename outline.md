# Serverless

- Traditional servers
- The lie of serverless
- Coldstarts
- Examples (GCP, AWS, Vercel, Netlify)

# Cloudflare Workers

- True serverless
- Locations even in Africa and China\*

- KV, cache, DO

# CFW examples

- Location headers for banner
- A/B testing (origin server)

# Downsides of Cloudflare Workers

- Constraints
- DX (error throwns, etc)
- Pricing?

# Alternatives to CFW

- Deno
- Vercel/Netlify?

- Extremely fast and hackable tooling for frontend
- Superb DX and is extendable (WS, etc)

# Vitedge

- Why SSR (you might not need SSR)
- Why CFW + Vite
- ESM + HMR
- Focus on DX and simplicity (1 entry point)
